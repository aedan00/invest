### <span class = "red">Crowdstrike <span class="smalltext-black">(Example)</span></span>

<img src="/hidden-pngs/hidden-crowdstrike.png" class="image" width="260" alt="Crowdstrike (CRWD)">

Crowdstrike is a leading cybersecurity company, which is part of the technology sector.  
Cybersecurity is a strong sector with room for tremendous growth as global cyberattacks rise.

Crowdstrike's share value has increased <span class = "green">**+72%**</span> in the last year.

Recently, leading cybersecurity firms Crowdstrike and Fortinet announced a partnership to provide endpoint threat protection across networks.

However, earlier this year, a global internet outage was caused by Crowdstrike on accident.  
The outage caused Crowdstrike's (CRWD) share value to decline **~30%** from its peak.

Revenue and earnings growth has escalated in recent fiscal years and quarters, with Crowdstrike recently reaching profitability in 2024. It is expected for their revenue growth to continuously reach **+20%** year over year, (Y/Y).

Crowdstrike, a leader in a strong sector, paired with rapidly rising growth, is set to outperform and have a successful future, in my opinion.
