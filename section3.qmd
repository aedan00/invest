### Intro
Welcome to section three --  
This section begins the discussion of Fundamental Analysis, a powerful topic used to evaluate the fair-value and future movement of a stock.  

Fundamental Analysis is an extremely important topic, and it is used all the time to make quality trades.

<span class = "highlight3_09">Pt. 1 focuses mainly on the qualitative-(company) part of Fundamental Analysis </span>  
<span class = "highlight3_09">Pt. 2 focuses mainly on the quantitative-(earnings) part of Fundamental Analysis </span>

  </div>

  <div id="step2" style="display: none;">
### Defined
Fundamental Analysis is the research into a company's financial state, growth, and earnings. It additionally dives into a company's qualitative features (quality), including insider-trading, moat, and other intrinsic data.  

  </div>

  <div id="step3" style="display: none;">
<!-- cont --> 
But at its core, Fundamental Analysis uses inherent/intrinsic factors to measure a stock's fair value and its future momentum.

**Earnings Reports:** <span class = "highlight1">Discussing financial reports from companies</span>  
**Quantitative (PREVIEW):** <span class = "highlight1">Previewing use of financial statistics and movement</span>  
**Qualitative: (FULL)** <span class="highlight1">Full evaluation of company intrinsics</span>

  </div>

  <div id="step5" style="display: none;">
### Earnings Reports
Earnings reports are one of the highlights of Fundamental Analysis.  

Every ~3 months, a company of the stock market must release a financial report detailing their financial state and numbers.

These reports contain major financial info about a company along with company updates.

  </div>

  <div id="step6" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
**Rapid Changes**:  

Sometimes, when earnings reports are released, they cause **rapid** change in a stock's price.  
The normally occurs when an earnings report contains either:  
<span class = "highlight3_09">
- Rapid financial growth or decline  
- Announcements that impact the future of the company
</span>

  </div>

  <div id="step7" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
**Example of Rapid Change**:  

As of time of this writing, Ford (F) released a significant earnings report.  

The report showed declining EPS from a year prior, along with an expectation of billions lost in revenue from declining sales.

The day after Ford's (F) bombshell earnings report, the stock lost <span class = "red">**18%**</span> of its value.

  </div>

  <div id="step8" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
Earnings reports are not only significant when it comes to rapid short-term change, they also are used to a stock's long-term performance.

  </div>

  <div id="step9" style="display: none;">
### <span class = "highlight2">Quantitative Aspects - PREVIEW</span>
<span class = "highlight">From net-income & revenue, to EPS trends, cash-flow, and EBITA, a multitude of factors <span class = "something1">(combined w/ share price)</span> exist to help us predict the future movement of a stock.</span> 

**Quantitative** Fundamental Analysis is comprised of financial statistics, such as listed above.

  </div>

  <div id="step10" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
Unfortunately, the *Quantitative* (Numerical) side of Fundamental Analysis is a <span class = "red">large topic</span>.  

But we'll go into full depth about the *Quantitative* parts in 'Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2'.

### Company Qualities
<span class = "highlight3">The next segments will easier to understand and more intuitive.</span>

Pertaining to intrinsic aspects of the company behind stock, a **Qualitative** approach examines the non-numerical factors of a company.

  </div>

  <div id="step14" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
"Qualitative" sounds complex, but here it really is just the <span class = "decrease">**"non-numeric quality"** or the **"non-numerical wellbeing"**</span> of a company.

  </div>

  <div id="step15" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
**Examples**

The *qualitative* aspect prominently includes:  
<span class = "highlight1">
- M/A <span class = "something1">(merger / acquisition)</span>  
- MOAT  
- insider-activity  
</span>

We'll go step-by-step through each point --

Companies are always trying to gain assets or increase their market-share.  
One method to do that is through **aquiring** (buying) another smaller company.  

They can do this by purchasing a majority or entirety of another company's stock. 

<img src="hidden-twtr-acquire.PNG" class="image" width="240" alt="Hidden Boeing Aquire">

Once a company has been acquired, its shares are often delisted from the stock market, becoming a private company.

  </div>

  <div id="step17" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
**Why does this Matter?:**  
Often, companies are acquired at valuations higher than their current valuation. 
This opportunity means the company being acquired typically sees a *immediate and significant* <span class = "green">**boost/spike**</span> to their stock price.

  </div>

  <div id="step18" style="display: none;">
### Moat
A economic "moat" is a competitive advantage a company over other competitors.

Similar to a medieval "moat", one side has the advantage, and the other is at a disadvantage.

  </div>

  <div id="step19" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
**Moats are competitive advantages within a sector.**

**For Example:**
Google *(GOOGL)* has a moat in the web industry.
Microsoft *(MSFT)* has a moat in the computer industry

Southwest Airlines *(LUV)* doesn't have a moat, as the airline industry has lots of competition.

  </div>

  <div id="step20" style="display: none;">
### Insider Activity
This subsection will demonstrate how to read through insider reports.
We will use [sec.gov/edgar/browse/](sec.gov/edgar/browse).

  </div>

  <div id="step21" style="display: none;">
<!-- ### -->
If you're not sure about a company, consult their insiders!  
Insiders, who are normally executives within the company, can tell you the most accurate confidence-level.
