**Fundamental Analysis Pt. 1**
</span>  
<span class="smalltext-black">FULL Version, unsegmented  </span>

### Intro
Welcome to section three --  
This section starts Fundamental Analysis, a powerful topic used to evaluate the fair-value and future movement of a stock.  

Fundamental Analysis is an extremely important topic, and it is necessary for a quality portfolio.

<span class = "highlight3_09">Pt. 1 focuses mainly on the qualitative-(company) part of Fundamental Analysis </span>  

### Defined
Fundamental Analysis measures a company's financial state, growth, and earnings. It additionally dives into a company's qualitative features (quality), including insider-trading, moat, and other intrinsic data.  

<!-- cont --> 
At its core, Fundamental Analysis uses inherent/intrinsic factors to measure a stock's fair value and its future momentum.


### Contents of this Section
<span class = "smalltext-black">Preview what is ahead.</span>  
<div class="info-box">
**Earnings Reports:** <span class = "highlight1">Discussing financial reports from companies</span>  
**Quantitative (PREVIEW):** <span class = "highlight1">Previewing use of financial statistics and movement</span>  
**Qualitative: (FULL)** <span class="highlight1">Full evaluation of company intrinsics</span></div>


### Earnings Reports
Earnings reports are one of the highlights of Fundamental Analysis.  

Every ~3 months, a company of the stock market must release a financial report detailing their financial state and numbers.

These reports contain major financial info about a company along with company updates.

<!-- ### -->
**Rapid Changes**:  

Sometimes, when earnings reports are released, they cause **rapid** change in a stock's price.  
The normally occurs when an earnings report contains either:  
<span class = "highlight3_09">
- Rapid financial growth or decline  
- Announcements that impact the future of the company
</span>

<!-- ### -->
**Example of Rapid Change**:  

As of time of this writing, Ford (F) released a significant earnings report.  

The report showed declining EPS from a year prior, along with an expectation of billions lost in revenue from declining sales.

The day after Ford's (F) bombshell earnings report, the stock lost <span class = "red">**18%**</span> of its value.

<!-- ### -->
Earnings reports are not only significant when it comes to rapid short-term change, they also are used to a stock's long-term performance.

<!-- ### -->
**Revenue**  
Earnings reports additionally deliver quarterly revenue along with past history of revenue.

Analyzing growing revenue is a good sign that the company is expanding.

### <span class = "highlight2">Quantitative Aspects - PREVIEW</span>
<span class = "highlight">From net-income & revenue, to EPS trends, cash-flow, and EBITA, a multitude of *numeric* factors <span class = "something1">(paired w/ share price)</span> exist to help us evaluate a stock.</span>

<div class="tip-box">

Quantitative Analysis is located in a future section **(Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2)**.  
Moving on...


### Qualitative Analysis - FULL
<span class = "highlight3">The next segments focus on Qualitative Analysis.</span>

A **Qualitative** approach examines the non-numerical factors of a company.
<div class="tip-box">
**Qualitative** Fundamental Analysis is essentially - company quality  
QUALITATIVE = Quality</div>


<!-- ### -->
"Qualitative" sounds complex, but here it really is just the <span class = "decrease">**"non-numeric quality"** or the **"non-numerical wellbeing"**</span> of a company.


<!-- ### -->
**Examples**

The *qualitative* aspects we'll talk about:  
<span class = "highlight1">
- Merger & Acquisition   
- Moat  
- Insider-activity  
- Sector prospects
</span>

We'll go step-by-step through each point --


### <span class = "red">M</span>erger and <span class = "red">A</span>cquisition (M/A)

<img src="hidden-boeing-aquire.PNG" class="image" width="260" alt="Hidden Boeing Aquire">

Companies are always trying to gain assets or increase their market-share.  
One method to do that is through **aquiring** (buying) another smaller company.  

They can do this by purchasing a majority or entirety of another company's stock. 

<img src="hidden-twtr-acquire.PNG" class="image" width="240" alt="Hidden Boeing Aquire">

Once a company has been acquired, its shares are often delisted from the stock market, becoming a private company.


<!-- ### -->
**Why does this Matter?:**  
Often, companies are acquired at valuations higher than their current valuation. 
This opportunity means the company being acquired typically sees a *immediate and significant* <span class = "green">**boost/spike**</span> to their stock price.

<div class="tip-box2">
A company making quality acquisitions gains assets & competitive-advantage

A company getting acquired could see an instant boost in share value</div>

<span class="smalltext-black">*assets = resources, patents, real-estate, [anything of value]</span>


### Moat
A economic "moat" is a competitive advantage a company over other competitors.

Higher market share = Higher advantage

<!-- ### -->
**Moats are competitive advantages within a sector.**  
<div class="tip-box2">
Choosing companies with strong *moats* assures a steady future, (by retaining high market share)</div>


### Insider Activity
This subsection will overview insider activity.
We will use [sec.gov/edgar/browse/](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings).


<!-- ### -->
Insider activity allows investors (like you and me), to view how company executives and officers trade their shares.

Is the CEO buying or selling? Insider activities allows us to check.


<!-- ### -->
<span class="green">We will talk all about **Insider Trading** during our meetings.</span>  

An in-depth tutorial on this website *might* be added in the future.  
`getting all the bits of insider activity would take too long to include here, and would draw on too long`

### Sector Prospects
The last part we'll talk about in this section of Qualitative Analysis is sector prospects.

Every company/stock you invest in belongs in a certain industry, (industry = sector).


<!-- ### -->
- Google = Tech Sector (Web), Tech Sector (Cloud)  
- Apple = Tech Sector & Hardware Sector  
- Amazon = Retail Sector, Tech Sector (Cloud)  
- Tesla = EV Sector  
- Crowdstrike = Cybersecurity (Tech) Sector  
- Nvidia = AI (Tech) Sector, Hardware Sector  
- Nike = Retail Sector  
- Chipotle = Food Sector  

The list goes on and on..  


**Sectors Prospects**  
<span class="highlight3_09">The overall prospects of a sector are important for every stock within that industry.</span>  

* Investing in a sector can be done by:  
    + <span class="highlight2_09">Investing in ETFs for the sector </span>  
        - <span class="something1">(example:) Buying the general cybersecurity fund (CIBR)</span>  
    + <span class="highlight2_09">Handpicking specific stocks within the sector </span>  
        - <span class="something1">(example:) Choosing CRWD & FTNT shares only</span>

### <span class="red">Piecing Everything Together</span>
After covering each of these **qualitative** topics, you may be wondering:  
"How do these topics help me?"

These qualitative factors that we discussed are crucial for informed investing:

- **Mergers and Acquisitions:** Can signal potential stock price movements. Acquiring companies gain assets, while those acquired may see price spikes.

- **Moats:** Companies with strong moats have lasting competitive advantages, helping them stay profitable despite competition.

- **Insider Activity:** Watching insider trades can reveal executives' confidence in their companyâ€™s future, guiding your investment decisions.

- **Sector Prospects:** Understanding sector growth potential helps focus investments on areas with the best opportunities.

By considering if a stock is strong in each of these factors, you can make more strategic investment choices.
