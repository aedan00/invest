### Intro
This section covers foundational stock terms and their interconnections. Its aim is to establish a solid foundation in stocks, laying the groundwork for upcoming content.

*For intermediate to more advanced traders, this section would serve only as a refresher.*  
<span class="something1">Sections with more advanced content are on their way and will be covered when we move to **Fundamental Analysis** and **Technical Analysis**.</span>

**The 'Guide' page contains the full list of topics and strategies.**

  </div>

  <div id="step2" style="display: none;">
### Market-Cap
Ready? Let's first talk about market-cap.  
    
Market-cap is simple to understand, but foundational and essential in all types of trading. 
    
Market-cap represents the value of a company, based upon the total value of all the company's shares of stock.
    
It is often seen as the total value of the company, for example, Apple (AAPL) has a market-cap of **~3.4 T**. Here, we would say "Apple is worth around 3.4 trillion".  

  </div>

  <div id="step3" style="display: none;">
<!-- transition -->
We'll revisit Market-Cap soon, lets run through Share Price first.  

  </div>

  <div id="step4" style="display: none;">
### Share Price
When trading stocks, most of the time you are buying & selling **shares**.  Shares represent small portions of companies. 

<span class="smalltext-black">**Did you know Elon Musk has 200 million shares of Tesla (TSLA)?  
Companies have hundreds of millions of shares total, some having billions of shares outstanding.** </span>

  </div>

  <div id="step5" style="display: none;">
Every share you buy has a price. Going back to our previous example, Apple (AAPL) has a share price of $220 / share.  

You aim to buy shares at lower share prices, and sell them for a higher price in the future.
    
  </div>

  <div id="step6" style="display: none;">
<!-- transition -->
**NOTE:** Never compare the share prices of different companies. Every company has its own unique share price.  

For example, Costco (COST)'s share price is $800, but Apple (AAPL)'s is $220/share.  
Does this mean Costco is bigger than Apple? **No**, in fact, Apple's valuation is 9x higher than Costco's.
    
  </div>

  <div id="step7" style="display: none;">
### Share Price and Market-Cap Relation
Let's revisit Market-Cap, and connect it to share price.

A company's market cap moves **proportional** to the share price of its stock.  
This is because market-cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of shares outstanding.
    
  </div>

  <div id="step8" style="display: none;">
<!-- transition -->
For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the share price goes up from $100 to $120, the market-cap would increase as follows:

- Initial market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $100/share = $100,000,000
- New market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $120/share = $120,000,000

This shows how a change in the share price directly affects the market-cap. 
    
  </div>

  <div id="step9" style="display: none;">
### Stock Fluctuation
Why do stocks move up and down?  
**Stocks fluctuate and move based on company performance**.

But at a technical level, it's a bit more complex.

  </div>

  <div id="step10" style="display: none;">
Share prices are affected directly by the demand of a stock.

When the demand of a stock is high, there are more willing buyers attempting to purchase shares. 
However, due to the limited number of shares, the stock price must move **up** in order to balance out the number of willing buyers and sellers.

Vice versa, when the demand is low, the are more willing sellers than buyers. In order to balance the number of willing buyers and sellers, the share price goes **down**, increasing the number of buyers while decreasing the number of sellers.

  </div>
  
  <div id="step11" style="display: none;">

This situation could be compared to the modern day supply chain. When there's high demand, prices are higher, and vice versa.

In the end, demand of a stock is influenced by the performance of the company, making  
**share price fluctuate based on the performance of the company**

  </div>

### -----------------------------------

The next couple sections will go by faster and will  highlight additional key terms.  

  </div>

  <div id="step13" style="display: none;">
### Volume
Volume is the number of shares traded in a day.

Volume can be used to represent how active a stock is.

  </div>

  <div id="step14" style="display: none;">
### Indexes
NASDAQ, DOW JONES, S&P 500?  
Do those names ring a bell?

These are called indexes, and they measure the overall performance of their sectors or subsets.

  </div>

  <div id="step15" style="display: none;">

Sectors are the various industries within the stock market as a whole.

**Prominent Indexes:**  
**NASDAQ:** technology and software sector  
**DOW JONES:** the 30 largest US companies  
**S&P 500:** the 500 largest US companies

  </div>

  <div id="step16" style="display: none;">

These indexes are often used to measure the wellbeing of the overall stock market, and in turn, the economy.

  </div>

  <div id="step17" style="display: none;">
### Earning Reports
Earning reports are one of the **most crucial factors** within the stock market.

At its core, they highlight a company's performance and economic state.

These include the revenue, net-income, EPS, forecast, and other factors of the company. <span class= "smalltext-black">(To be covered later on)</span>

  </div>

  <div id="step18" style="display: none;">
They play a critical role in determining price movement and they often lead to significant volatility and rapid price changes.

Because **earnings are important** and advanced, we will fully cover them when we start **Fundamental Analysis**.
