Crowdstrike (CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity company, securing many organizations across the world against cyberthreats.  
The cybersecurity sector is a strong sector with room for tremendous growth as global cyberattacks rise.

Recently, leading cybersecurity firms Crowdstrike and Fortinet announced a partnership to provide endpoint threat protection across networks, combining Crowdstrike's expertise in endpoint security with Fortinet's edge in network security.

Earlier this year, Crowdstrike issued a faulty update to endpoint devices across the world.    
The resulting outage caused Crowdstrike's (CRWD) share value to decline **~30%** from its peak.
While the outage was severe, majority of organizations impacted were able to mobilize almost immediately, shortly after the incident.  
In response, Crowdstrike promptly issued remediation and support to affected customers.

Revenue and earnings growth have escalated in recent fiscal years and quarters, with Crowdstrike recently reaching profitability in 2024. It is expected for their revenue growth to continuously hit **+20%** year over year, (Y/Y).

Crowdstrike, a leader in a strong sector, paired with rapidly rising growth, is set to outperform and have a successful future, in my opinion.

Crowdstrike's share value has increased <span class = "green">**+21.2%**</span> YTD (at time of writing).
