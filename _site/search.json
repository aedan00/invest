    "text": "Important Stock Market Basics \nClick on ‘Next’ to move to each section\n\n\n\nIntro\nThis tutorial covers foundational stock terms and their interconnections. Its aim is to establish a solid foundation in stocks, laying the groundwork for upcoming content.\nFor intermediate to more advanced traders, this tutorial would serve only as a refresher.\nTutorials and topics with more advanced content are on their way and will be covered when we move to Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.\nThe ‘Guide’ page contains the full list of topics and strategies.\n\n\n\n\nMarket-Cap\nReady? Let’s first talk about market-cap.\nMarket-cap is simple to understand, but foundational and essential in all types of trading.\nMarket-cap represents the value of a company, based upon the total value of all the company’s shares of stock.\nIt is often seen as the total value of the company, for example, Apple (AAPL) has a market-cap of ~3.4 T. Here, we would say “Apple is worth around 3.4 trillion”.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll revisit Market-Cap soon, lets run through Share Price first.\n\n\n\nShare Price\nWhen trading stocks, most of the time you are buying & selling shares. Shares represent small portions of companies.\nDid you know Elon Musk has 200 million shares of Tesla?\nCompanies have hundreds of millions of shares total, some having billions of shares outstanding. \n\n\n\nEvery share you buy has a price. Going back to our previous example, Apple (AAPL) has a share price of $220 / share.\nYou aim to buy shares at lower share prices, and sell them for a higher price in the future.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Never compare the share prices of different companies. Every company has its own unique share price.\nFor example, Costco (COST)’s share price is $800, but Apple (AAPL)’s is $220/share.\nDoes this mean Costco is bigger than Apple? No, in fact, Apple’s valuation is 9x higher than Costco’s.\n\n\n\nShare Price and Market-Cap Relation\nLet’s revisit Market-Cap, and connect it to share price.\nA company’s market cap moves proportional to the share price of its stock.\nThis is because market-cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the share price goes up from $100 to $120, the market-cap would increase as follows:\n\nInitial market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $100/share = $100,000,000\nNew market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $120/share = $120,000,000\n\nThis shows how a change in the share price directly affects the market-cap.\n\n\n\nStock Fluctuation\nWhy do stocks move up and down?\nStocks fluctuate and move based on company performance.\nBut at a technical level, it’s a bit more complex.\n\n\n\nShare prices are affected directly by the demand of a stock.\nWhen the demand of a stock is high, there are more willing buyers attempting to purchase shares. However, due to the limited number of shares, the stock price must move up in order to balance out the number of willing buyers and sellers.\nVice versa, when the demand is low, the are more willing sellers than buyers. In order to balance the number of willing buyers and sellers, the share price goes down, increasing the number of buyers while decreasing the number of sellers.\n\n\nThis situation could be compared to the modern day supply chain. When there’s high demand, prices are higher, and vice versa.\nIn the end, demand of a stock is influenced by the performance of the company, making\nshare price fluctuate based on the performance of the company\n\n\n\n———————\nThe next couple sections will go by faster and will simply highlight additional key terms.\n\n\n\n\nVolume\nVolume is the number of shares traded in a day.\nVolume can be used to represent how active a stock is.\n\n\n\n\nIndexes\nHave you heard of the NASDAQ, DOW JONES, or S&P 500?\nChances are, you’ve likely heard them on TV.\n\n\n\nThese are called indexes, and they measure their overall sector’s performance.\nNASDAQ: technology and software sector\nDOW JONES: the 30 largest US companies\nS&P 500: the 500 largest US companies\n\n\nThese indexes are often used to measure the wellbeing of the overall stock market, and in turn, the economy.\n\n\n\nEarning Reports\nEarning reports are one of the most crucial factors within the stock market.\nThey highlight a company’s performance and economic factors.\nThese include the revenue, net-income, EPS, forecast, and other factors of the company. (To be covered later on)\n\n\n\nThey play a critical role in determining stock movement and they often lead to significant volatility and rapid price changes.\nWe will discuss earnings reports, their significance, and how to read them, when we cover Fundamental Analysis.\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading the Tutorial for “Important Stock Market Basics”.\nThis tutorial has covered the essentials and groundwork related to stocks, which will be crucial for our future material and discussions.\n\n\n\n\nCredits\nWritten by: Aedan Liao\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n| Home | About"
