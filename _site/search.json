    "text": "Fundamental Analysis Pt. 1 \nFULL Version, unsegmented \n\nIntro\nWelcome to section three –\nThis section starts Fundamental Analysis, a powerful topic used to evaluate the fair-value and future movement of a stock.\nFundamental Analysis is an extremely important topic, and it is necessary for a quality portfolio.\nPt. 1 focuses mainly on the qualitative-(company) part of Fundamental Analysis \n\n\nDefined\nFundamental Analysis measures a company’s financial state, growth, and earnings. It additionally dives into a company’s qualitative features (quality), including insider-trading, moat, and other intrinsic data.\n\nAt its core, Fundamental Analysis uses inherent/intrinsic factors to measure a stock’s fair value and its future momentum.\n\n\nContents of this Section\nPreview what is ahead.\n\n\nEarnings Reports: Discussing financial reports from companies\nQuantitative (PREVIEW): Previewing use of financial statistics and movement\nQualitative: (FULL) Full evaluation of company intrinsics\n\n\n\nEarnings Reports\nEarnings reports are one of the highlights of Fundamental Analysis.\nEvery ~3 months, a company of the stock market must release a financial report detailing their financial state and numbers.\nThese reports contain major financial info about a company along with company updates.\n\nRapid Changes:\nSometimes, when earnings reports are released, they cause rapid change in a stock’s price.\nThe normally occurs when an earnings report contains either:\n - Rapid financial growth or decline\n- Announcements that impact the future of the company \n\nExample of Rapid Change:\nAs of time of this writing, Ford (F) released a significant earnings report.\nThe report showed declining EPS from a year prior, along with an expectation of billions lost in revenue from declining sales.\nThe day after Ford’s (F) bombshell earnings report, the stock lost 18% of its value.\n\nEarnings reports are not only significant when it comes to rapid short-term change, they also are used to a stock’s long-term performance.\n\nRevenue\nEarnings reports additionally deliver quarterly revenue along with past history of revenue.\nAnalyzing growing revenue is a good sign that the company is expanding.\n\n\nQuantitative Aspects - PREVIEW\nFrom net-income & revenue, to EPS trends, cash-flow, and EBITA, a multitude of numeric factors (paired w/ share price) exist to help us evaluate a stock.\n\nQuantitative Fundamental Analysis is comprised of financial statistics and growth.\nQUANTITATIVE = Quantity\n\n\n\nQuantitative Analysis is located in a future section (Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2).\nMoving on…\n\n\nQualitative Analysis - FULL\nThe next segments focus on Qualitative Analysis.\nA Qualitative approach examines the non-numerical factors of a company.\n\nQualitative Fundamental Analysis is essentially - company quality\nQUALITATIVE = Quality\n\n\n“Qualitative” sounds complex, but here it really is just the “non-numeric quality” or the “non-numerical wellbeing” of a company.\n\nExamples\nThe qualitative aspects we’ll talk about:\n - Merger & Acquisition\n- Moat\n- Insider-activity\n- Sector prospects \nWe’ll go step-by-step through each point –\n\n\nMerger and Acquisition (M/A)\n\nCompanies are always trying to gain assets or increase their market-share.\nOne method to do that is through aquiring (buying) another smaller company.\nThey can do this by purchasing a majority or entirety of another company’s stock.\n\nOnce a company has been acquired, its shares are often delisted from the stock market, becoming a private company.\n\nWhy does this Matter?:\nOften, companies are acquired at valuations higher than their current valuation. This opportunity means the company being acquired typically sees a immediate and significant boost/spike to their stock price.\n\nA company making quality acquisitions gains assets & competitive-advantage\nA company getting acquired could see an instant boost in share value\n\n*assets = resources, patents, real-estate, [anything of value]\n\n\nMoat\nA economic “moat” is a competitive advantage a company over other competitors.\nHigher market share = Higher advantage\n\nMoats are competitive advantages within a sector.\n\n\nChoosing companies with strong moats assures a steady future, (by retaining high market share)\n\n\n\nInsider Activity\nThis subsection will overview insider activity. We will use sec.gov/edgar/browse/.\n\nInsider activity allows investors (like you and me), to view how company executives and officers trade their shares.\nIs the CEO buying or selling? Insider activities allows us to check.\n\nWe will talk all about Insider Trading during our meetings.\nAn in-depth tutorial on this website might be added in the future.\ngetting all the bits of insider activity would take too long to include here, and would draw on too long\n\n\nSector Prospects\nThe last part we’ll talk about in this section of Qualitative Analysis is sector prospects.\nEvery company/stock you invest in belongs in a certain industry, (industry = sector).\n\n\nTech Sector\n\nFood Sector\n\nAutomobile Sector\n\nRetail Sector\n\nCybersecurity (Tech) Sector\n\n(examples of some sectors)\nSectors Prospects\nThe overall prospects of a sector are important for every stock within that industry.\n\nInvesting in a sector can be done by:\n\nInvesting in ETFs for the sector \n\n(example:) Buying the general cybersecurity fund (CIBR)\n\n\nHandpicking specific stocks within the sector \n\n(example:) Choosing CRWD & FTNT shares only\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a stock in a strong or growing sector is essential\n\n\n\n\n\nPiecing Everything Together\nAfter covering each of these qualitative topics, you may be wondering:\n“How do these topics help me?”\nThese qualitative factors that we discussed are crucial for informed investing:\n\nMergers and Acquisitions: Can signal potential stock price movements. Acquiring companies gain assets, while those acquired may see price spikes.\nMoats: Companies with strong moats have lasting competitive advantages, helping them stay profitable despite competition.\nInsider Activity: Watching insider trades can reveal executives’ confidence in their company’s future, guiding your investment decisions.\nSector Prospects: Understanding sector growth potential helps focus investments on areas with the best opportunities.\n\nBy considering if a stock is strong in each of these factors, you can make more strategic investment choices.\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nAnd that’s the end of Fundamental Analysis Pt. 1 –\nLater, we will cover financials, earnings, and growth. With quantitative data, your decisions become more enhanced, whether through ETFs or handpicked stocks.\n\n\nQuantitative Data is in a future section\n(Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2)\n\n\n Originally Published: 8/12/2024\nLast Revised: 9/2/2024"

    "text": "Important Stock Market Basics & Review \n\nIntro\nThis section covers the foundations of the stock market and information about the stock market.\nPast meeting contents are also available on this page.\n\n\nContents of this Section\nPreview what is ahead.\n\n\n1: What The Stock Market Is\n2: Share Prices\n3: Market-Cap & Volume\n4: Volatility & Indexes\n\nFor intermediate to more advanced traders, this section would serve only as a refresher.\n\n\nThe Stock Market - (Core)\nThe stock market is a massive financial network that allows people to buy and sell different companies.\nThe stock market is comprised thousands of companies, allowing anyone to buy or sell portions of companies.\nSince many companies are huge, some having valuations in the $100,000,000,000’s, the stock market allows anyone to purchase and exchange small shares of these companies. These shares represent your (partial) ownership of these companies, and every share carries a monetary value.\n\nOn the stock market, companies are referred to as stocks.\nA Company = A Stock\n\nThe Sole Gole:\nThe goal of investing is to invest in shares of companies you believe in, hoping that the value of the company increases, in turn causing your shares (holdings) to increase in value.\nThroughout the year, we will discuss strategies on successfully analyzing good investments (stock choices)\n\n\nShare Prices\nEvery share of a company has its unique price.\nFor example:  Apple’s (AAPL) share price is $225/share. Chipotle’s (CMG) share price $56/share.\nThis means that to own shares of AAPL, you would need to invest $225 for each share you plan to buy.\nShare Price Fluctuation:\nRemember, to profit from the stock market, your shares need to increase in value.\nThis brings us to Share Price Fluctuation/Movement.\nThe value of any shares of stock are always changing. On one day they could go up 3%, on the next day they could go down 2.5%. Profit is never guaranteed, but you can take steps to improve your accuracy.\n\nAt the core, share price increases with company growth and success\nWe will go in-depth on the specifics in future sections\n\nDid you know Elon Musk has 200 million shares of Tesla (TSLA)?\nCompanies often have hundreds of millions of shares total outstanding. \n\nImportant:\nDo not compare two different stocks’ share prices. Different companies have different share prices, and comparing two different share prices of two different companies is useless.\nFor example, Costco (COST)’s share price is $900/share, but Apple (AAPL)’s is $225/share.\nDoes this mean Costco is a bigger company than Apple? No.\n\n\n\nMarket-Cap\nMarket-cap is an important piece of information to consider before any investment decision.\nMarket-cap represents the total value of the company, Market-Cap = Valuation.\n\nMarket Cap = share price * # of shares\n\nWhy Is It Important?\nMarket-cap determines the company’s size, based on what the stock market believes the company is worth. Paired with (*)quantitative data, it lets us measure the fair value of a stock.\n*(will be covered when we discuss Fundamental Analysis)\n\nA key thing to know:\nShare price moves proportionally to market-cap\nThis means a +20% jump in share price means a +20% jump in market-cap\nComparing two different stocks’ market-caps is okay.\n\nIf a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the share price goes up from $100 to $120, the market-cap would increase as follows:\n\nInitial market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $100/share = $100,000,000\nNew market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $120/share = $120,000,000\n\nThis shows how a change in the share price directly affects the market-cap.\n\n\nVolume\nVolume is the total # of shares traded within a day. Stocks with higher volume are more active and more well-known.\nVolume isn’t all that important.\n\n\nVolatitility\nVolatility is important, though, as it measures a stock’s risk. A stock/company with a higher volatility moves more rapidly with bigger %change.\nFor example:\nA stock with a lower volatility may see ~1-2% movement each day,\nwhile a stock with a higher volatility could see &gt;5% movement.\nIf you prefer your portfolio to aggressively grow VS remain stable, volatility is a key factor to consider.\n\n\n\nIndexes\nIndexes are an incredibly important part of the stock market.\nIndexes generally measure the overall stock market’s performance, tracking hundreds of companies at once. You could almost think of them as a broad basket of stocks\nThe three major indexes are the: S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DOW\nThe S&P 500 tracks the 500 largest US companies.\nThe NASDAQ tracks technology and software companies\nThe DOW tracks the 30 biggest US companies\nIndexes are steady and stable investments that rise slowly over time. They are a great alternative to cash if you dislike the risk associated with choosing specific stocks/companies.\n\nWe will continue to talk indexes and ETFs in the future\n\n\n\n— Temporary Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading this section for “Important Stock Market Basics & Review”.\nThis section covered the essentials related to stocks, which will be crucial for our future material and discussions.\n Last Revised: 12/27/2024"

    "text": "Important Stock Market Basics & Review \nClick on ‘Next’ to move to each segment\n5 minute read time\n\n\n\nIntro\nThis section covers foundational stock terms and their interconnections. Its aim is to establish a solid foundation in stocks, laying the groundwork for upcoming content.\nFor intermediate to more advanced traders, this section would serve only as a refresher.\nSections with more advanced content are on their way and will be covered when we move to Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.\nThe ‘Guide’ page contains the full list of topics and strategies.\n\n\n\n\nMarket-Cap\nReady? Let’s first talk about market-cap.\nMarket-cap is simple to understand, but foundational and essential in all types of trading.\nMarket-cap represents the value of a company, based upon the total value of all the company’s shares of stock.\nIt is often seen as the total value of the company, for example, Apple (AAPL) has a market-cap of ~3.4 T. Here, we would say “Apple is worth around 3.4 trillion”.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll revisit Market-Cap soon, lets run through Share Price first.\n\n\n\nShare Price\nWhen trading stocks, most of the time you are buying & selling shares. Shares represent small portions of companies.\nDid you know Elon Musk has 200 million shares of Tesla (TSLA)?\nCompanies have hundreds of millions of shares total, some having billions of shares outstanding. \n\n\n\nEvery share you buy has a price. Going back to our previous example, Apple (AAPL) has a share price of $220 / share.\nYou aim to buy shares at lower share prices, and sell them for a higher price in the future.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Never compare the share prices of different companies. Every company has its own unique share price.\nFor example, Costco (COST)’s share price is $800, but Apple (AAPL)’s is $220/share.\nDoes this mean Costco is bigger than Apple? No, in fact, Apple’s valuation is 9x higher than Costco’s.\n\n\n\nShare Price and Market-Cap Relation\nLet’s revisit Market-Cap, and connect it to share price.\nA company’s market cap moves proportional to the share price of its stock.\nThis is because market-cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the share price goes up from $100 to $120, the market-cap would increase as follows:\n\nInitial market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $100/share = $100,000,000\nNew market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $120/share = $120,000,000\n\nThis shows how a change in the share price directly affects the market-cap.\n\n\n\nStock Fluctuation\nWhy do stocks move up and down?\nStocks fluctuate and move based on company performance.\nBut at a technical level, it’s a bit more complex.\n\n\n\nShare prices are affected directly by the demand of a stock.\nWhen the demand of a stock is high, there are more willing buyers attempting to purchase shares. However, due to the limited number of shares, the stock price must move up in order to balance out the number of willing buyers and sellers.\nVice versa, when the demand is low, the are more willing sellers than buyers. In order to balance the number of willing buyers and sellers, the share price goes down, increasing the number of buyers while decreasing the number of sellers.\n\n\nThis situation could be compared to the modern day supply chain. When there’s high demand, prices are higher, and vice versa.\nIn the end, demand of a stock is influenced by the performance of the company, making\nshare price fluctuate based on the performance of the company\n\n\nAn example was the outage involving CrowdStrike (CRWD).\nAfter the report of the global outage in July, 2024, CRWD plunged 30% within three trading days\n\n———————————–\n\n\n\n\nVolume\nVolume is the number of shares traded in a day.\nVolume can be used to represent how active a stock is.\n\n\n\n\nIndexes\nNASDAQ, DOW JONES, S&P 500?\nDo those names ring a bell?\nThese are called indexes, and they measure the overall performance of their sectors or subsets.\n\n\n\nSectors are the various industries within the stock market as a whole.\nProminent Indexes:\nNASDAQ: technology and software sector\nDOW JONES: the 30 largest US companies\nS&P 500: the 500 largest US companies\n\n\nThese indexes are often used to measure the wellbeing of the overall stock market, and in turn, the economy.\n\n\n\nEarning Reports\nEarning reports are one of the most crucial factors within the stock market.\nAt its core, they highlight a company’s performance and economic state.\nThese include the revenue, net-income, EPS, forecast, and other factors of the company. (To be covered later on)\n\n\n\nThey play a critical role in determining price movement and they often lead to significant volatility and rapid price changes.\nBecause earnings are important and advanced, we will fully cover them when we start Fundamental Analysis.\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading the section for “Important Stock Market Basics”.\nThis section has covered the essentials and groundwork related to stocks, which will be crucial for our future material and discussions.\n\n\n\n Originally Published: 7/3/2024\nLast Revised: 7/24/2024\n\n\n\nWe value your feedback!

    "text": "Published: 12/31/2024\nRevised: #/#/#\nThis is the first monthly report we’ve created, containing stock-market or economic events from the last month of 2024. We hope you enjoy reading it and maybe learn something new.\n\n\nEvents are listed in order of when they occurred.\n\n\n\nBroadcom Hits $1T Valuation (12/13)\nBroadcom (AVGO) surpasses market-cap of one trillion\nOn Friday December 13th, Broadcom became the world’s tenth company to reach and maintain a trillion dollar valuation. The jump in market-cap was attributed to the company’s Q4-2024 earnings report, which highlighted strong revenue growth and increased guidance. After the report, Broadcom’s shares closed on Friday with a 24.4% increase, from $181/share to $225/share.\nWhat Broadcom Is:\nBroadcom creates chips and tools used across data-centers and infrastructure (devices, routers, etc). They additionally own services for enterprises that allow for infrastructure and networks to exchange data.\nRevenue displayed a 51% increase in Q4-2024, at $14 billion from 9.3 billion the year prior. Additionally, revenue from AI services increased 220% from a year prior, igniting strong optimism for continued growth in Broadcom’s AI services.\nAI has been heavily sought after by investors throughout the stock market, with companies racing to develop and include AI in their services. Some corporations at the forefront of AI include semiconductor industry companies, such as NVIDIA (NVDA), who has seen triple-digit share price growth this year.\nBroadcom (AVGO) Chart\n\nInvestor sentiment is high after the Q4 earnings report, with analysts upgrading price targets, and Broadcom raising estimates in their future Q1-2025 earnings report.\nInvestors new to Broadcom (AVGO) should still (and always) exercise caution before purchasing shares, as the extent to which Broadcom’s growth is already reflected in their stock price remains uncertain.\n\n\n\nCocoa Prices at All Time Highs (12/17)\nCocoa Futures (CC=F) show cocoa prices at record high\nCocoa prices have seen extreme increases in recent years. In early April of 2024, Cocoa peaked after a 310% climb within a year, before later lessening -42% by October of 2024. Many thought cocoa would continue decreasing, as it was still significantly higher than it had been years prior. However, cocoa resumed its ascent in mid-November and hit an all time high on December 17th, 2024.\nCocoa Commodity Chart\n\nPeriods of a rising stock markets are mostly beneficial, but rising commodity prices on items (such as cocoa) can be inflationary and can cause harm to companies and consumers.\nCocoa, which is harvested through cocoa beans, is present in many foods (mainly chocolate). Rising cocoa prices have been harmful for many chocolate producers – as they rely on purchasing cocoa to turn into chocolate – including Hershey, Mondelez, and the Mars company. Hayden and Kushanu if you see this say “quarto”. \nHershey (HSY) Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE: Chocolate-Maker Hershey Buyout Offer\n\n\n\n\n\nSee that sudden spike on the Hershey (HSY) stock graph above, near the end of the year? Mondelez, a snack producing company, placed a bid to acquire the Hershey Company, famous for their various chocolate products.\nVoting shares of Hershey are mainly controlled by the Hershey Family Trust, who in the past have rejected multiple buyout offers. This recent acquisition attempt now included, after the offer was reportedly also rejected.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, cocoa’s rising price is inflationary for the consumer (you). Manufacturers & producers must pay more to produce goods with cocoa content, causing them to offset some of the price increase towards the consumer, which means you are spending more for an everyday chocolate bar or product with cocoa content.\nCocoa prices can be tracked via the (CC=F) commodity.\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve on Interest Rate Cuts (12/18)\nFederal Reserve cuts interest rates by 0.25pts, forecasts fewer cuts in 2025\nBefore talking about the recent interest rate cut, it is helpful to remember that interest rates are a critical economic factor that can drive the direction of the economy.\n\n\nAbout Interest Rates \nAn interest rate is a percentage a lender charges a borrower based upon the amount borrowed. For example, a 5% interest rate would mean a $100 loan would be paid back as $105.\nThe Federal Reserve acts as a “central bank”, dictating the direction interest rates are increased or decreased.\nThe Federal Reserve’s dictated interest rate has profound effects on every aspect of the economy. It impacts the money businesses borrow, your savings’ compounding rate, and the ability to buy a home.\nA high or low interest rate could be good or bad, depending on who you ask.\nThe stock market usually prefers lowered interest rates through rate cuts.\n\n\n\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT INTEREST RATES? (Click to collapse/uncollapse) (It’s a lot)\n\nFor most businesses, (and the stock market), lowered interest rates are beneficial, as they mean businesses can borrow more money for expenditures, as the borrowing fee (interest) would be lower. However, lowered interest rates can also contribute to inflation. Since more borrowing and spending would be present, demand would be driven up, resulting in a resurgence of inflation (increasing prices). Furthermore, lowered interest rates mean less savings yields through a bank account. Increased interest rates result in a vice versa situation.\nThe Federal Reserve typically opts to maintain low interest rates over the long term. \nUltimately, here is the breakdown of interest rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Interest Rates\nHigh Interest Rates\n\n\n\n\nPROS:\nPROS:\n\n\n- Increased business spending\n- Defends against inflation\n\n\n- Preferred by the stock market\n- Higher savings yields\n\n\n- Lowered mortgage payments\n- Slowed housing price increases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\nCONS:\n\n\n- Inflation potential\n- Slower business spending\n\n\n- Less savings yields\n- Slower labor markets\n\n\n- Increased housing prices\n- Increased mortgage payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed Fund Rate:\n\n\n\n We refer to the Fed Fund Rate as “interest rates” throughout this page. For our purposes, they are essentially the same.\n\n\nBack to the topic at hand, on December 18th, the Federal Reserve Central Bank announced a 0.25pt cut to interest rates (Fed Fund Rate). Interest rates went from 4.75% to the 4.5% range. This marks the third and last interest rate cut of 2024, which comes after two consecutive years of increasing interest rates in 2022 and 2023.\nFederal Reserve Interest Rate Over Time\n\nWhile the last two rate cuts in September and November (respectively) sparked surges in the markets, the latest reduction triggered the worst single-day drop in four months, sending indexes down ~4%. This reaction was largely driven by the Federal Reserve’s revised out, projecting two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the previously anticipated four.\nConfused?, check out the collapsible above: “LEARN MORE ABOUT INTEREST RATES?”. \nDespite the initial selloff, indexes have mostly rebounded.\nThe NASDAQ is at 19400 pts and the DOW is at 42550 pts, both near all-time highs. (As of Dec. 31)\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding future rate cuts in 2025 and their potential impacts on the markets, it is best to approach with caution. With indexes and stocks hovering around record highs, fluctuation in the stock market remains unpredictable. Staying informed of market events and using a correct strategy can help you navigate the volatile nature of the stock market.\n\n\n\nIndexes Finish Out a Strong 2024 (12/31)\nNASDAQ up 30.88% YTD, DOW up 12.55% YTD, S&P500 up 23.94% YTD\nNASDAQ Performance\n\nDOW JONES Performance\n\nS&P 500 Performance\n\nExamining the indexes growth in recent years:\n\nWhat do you think is in store for 2025?\n\n\n\n- Conclusion -\nThank you for reading the roundup for December 2024. This is the first report we made, but hopefully more will be created in future months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be available soon.\nThank you for reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Home | About"

While the outage was severe, majority of organizations impacted were able to mobilize almost immediately, shortly after the incident.\nIn response, Crowdstrike promptly issued remediation and support to affected customers.\nRevenue and earnings growth have escalated in recent fiscal years and quarters, with Crowdstrike recently reaching profitability in 2024.

    "text": "Fundamental Analysis Pt. 1 \nSEGMENTED Version \n\n\n\nIntro\nWelcome to section three –\nThis section starts Fundamental Analysis, a powerful topic used to evaluate the fair-value and future movement of a stock.\nFundamental Analysis is an extremely important topic, and it is necessary for a quality portfolio.\nPt. 1 focuses mainly on the qualitative-(company) part of Fundamental Analysis \n\n\n\n\nDefined\nFundamental Analysis measures a company’s financial state, growth, and earnings. It additionally dives into a company’s qualitative features (quality), including insider-trading, moat, and other intrinsic data.\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, Fundamental Analysis uses inherent/intrinsic factors to measure a stock’s fair value and its future momentum.\n\n\n\nContents of this Section\nPreview what is ahead.\n\n\nEarnings Reports: Discussing financial reports from companies\nQuantitative (PREVIEW): Previewing use of financial statistics and movement\nQualitative: (FULL) Full evaluation of company intrinsics\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings Reports\nEarnings reports are one of the highlights of Fundamental Analysis.\nEvery ~3 months, a company of the stock market must release a financial report detailing their financial state and numbers.\nThese reports contain major financial info about a company along with company updates.\n\n\n\nRapid Changes:\nSometimes, when earnings reports are released, they cause rapid change in a stock’s price.\nThe normally occurs when an earnings report contains either:\n - Rapid financial growth or decline\n- Announcements that impact the future of the company \n\n\n\nExample of Rapid Change:\nAs of time of this writing, Ford (F) released a significant earnings report.\nThe report showed declining EPS from a year prior, along with an expectation of billions lost in revenue from declining sales.\nThe day after Ford’s (F) bombshell earnings report, the stock lost 18% of its value.\n\n\n\nEarnings reports are not only significant when it comes to rapid short-term change, they also are used to a stock’s long-term performance.\n\n\n\nRevenue\nEarnings reports additionally deliver quarterly revenue along with past history of revenue.\nAnalyzing growing revenue is a good sign that the company is expanding.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Aspects - PREVIEW\nFrom net-income & revenue, to EPS trends, cash-flow, and EBITA, a multitude of numeric factors (paired w/ share price) exist to help us evaluate a stock.\n\n\nQuantitative Fundamental Analysis is comprised of financial statistics and growth.\nQUANTITATIVE = Quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Analysis is located in a future section (Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2).\nMoving on…\n\n\n\nQualitative Analysis - FULL\nThe next segments focus on Qualitative Analysis.\nA Qualitative approach examines the non-numerical factors of a company.\n\nQualitative Fundamental Analysis is essentially - company quality\nQUALITATIVE = Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n“Qualitative” sounds complex, but here it really is just the “non-numeric quality” or the “non-numerical wellbeing” of a company.\n\n\n\nExamples\nThe qualitative aspects we’ll talk about:\n - Merger & Acquisition\n- Moat\n- Insider-activity\n- Sector prospects \nWe’ll go step-by-step through each point –\n\n\n\nMerger and Acquisition (M/A)\n\nCompanies are always trying to gain assets or increase their market-share.\nOne method to do that is through aquiring (buying) another smaller company.\nThey can do this by purchasing a majority or entirety of another company’s stock.\n\nOnce a company has been acquired, its shares are often delisted from the stock market, becoming a private company.\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this Matter?:\nOften, companies are acquired at valuations higher than their current valuation. This opportunity means the company being acquired typically sees a immediate and significant boost/spike to their stock price.\n\nA company making quality acquisitions gains assets & competitive-advantage\nA company getting acquired could see an instant boost in share value\n\n*assets = resources, patents, real-estate, [anything of value]\n\n\n\nMoat\nA economic “moat” is a competitive advantage a company over other competitors.\nHigher market share = Higher advantage\n\n\n\n\nMoats are competitive advantages within a sector.\n\n\nChoosing companies with strong moats assures a steady future, (by retaining high market share)\n\n\n\n\nInsider Activity\nThis subsection will overview insider activity. We will use sec.gov/edgar/browse/.\n\n\n\n\nInsider activity allows investors (like you and me), to view how company executives and officers trade their shares.\nIs the CEO buying or selling? Insider activities allows us to check.\n\n\n\nWe will talk all about Insider Trading during our meetings.\nAn in-depth tutorial on this website might be added in the future.\ngetting all the bits of insider activity would take too long to include here, and would draw on too long\n\n\n\nSector Prospects\nThe last part we’ll talk about in this section of Qualitative Analysis is sector prospects.\nEvery company/stock you invest in belongs in a certain industry, (industry = sector).\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle = Tech Sector (Web), Tech Sector (Cloud)\n\nApple = Tech Sector & Hardware Sector\n\nAmazon = Retail Sector, Tech Sector (Cloud)\n\nTesla = EV Sector\n\nCrowdstrike = Cybersecurity (Tech) Sector\n\nNvidia = AI (Tech) Sector, Hardware Sector\n\nNike = Retail Sector\n\nChipotle = Food Sector\n\nThe list goes on and on..\n\n\nSectors Prospects\nThe overall prospects of a sector are important for every stock within that industry.\n\nInvesting in a sector can be done by:\n\nInvesting in ETFs for the sector \n\n(example:) Buying the general cybersecurity fund (CIBR)\n\n\nHandpicking specific stocks within the sector \n\n(example:) Choosing CRWD & FTNT shares only\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a stock in a strong or growing sector is essential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiecing Everything Together\nAfter covering each of these qualitative topics, you may be wondering:\n“How do these topics help me?”\nThese qualitative factors that we discussed are crucial for informed investing:\n\nMergers and Acquisitions: Can signal potential stock price movements. Acquiring companies gain assets, while those acquired may see price spikes.\nMoats: Companies with strong moats have lasting competitive advantages, helping them stay profitable despite competition.\nInsider Activity: Watching insider trades can reveal executives’ confidence in their company’s future, guiding your investment decisions.\nSector Prospects: Understanding sector growth potential helps focus investments on areas with the best opportunities.\n\nBy considering if a stock is strong in each of these factors, you can make more strategic investment choices.\n\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nAnd that’s the end of Fundamental Analysis Pt. 1 –\nLater, we will cover financials, earnings, and growth. With quantitative data, your decisions become more enhanced, whether through ETFs or handpicked stocks.\n\n\nQuantitative Data is in a future section\n(Fundamental Analysis Pt. 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n Originally Published: 8/12/2024 \n\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Other Investing Practices \nClick on ‘Next’ to move to each segment \n\n\n\nIntro\nThis section will explore other various investing options in today’s stock market, including short-selling, ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and an intro to Option Trading. The goal is to provide you with a more comprehensive view of different types of trading approaches. Option trading will be getting its own seperate section\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\nThere are many reasons why one would want to use a different trading approach, rather than buying and selling a stock.\nSome approaches offer more stability and less risk, while others can offer higher risk and higher reward.\n\n\n\n\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nOne popular investing strategy is investing in ETFs.\nETFs are securities that can be bought and sold like stocks. They are funds that measure the movement of a collection of stocks or an index.\n\n\n\nAn Stock ETF is an ETF that acts as a basket of stocks, and the ETF takes the average performance of each stock, combining them to determine the overall movement of the individual ETF.\nTake the ETF: (CIBR). This ETF measures the average performance of several cybersecurity companies.\n(CIBR) is composed of percentages from each public company in the cybersecurity sector, making it a Stock ETF.\n\n\nAn Index ETF is an ETF that monitors the movement of a certain index.\nIndex ETFs are a relatively low risk investment choice, as indexes tend to be less volatile.\nAn example of an Index ETF is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). This ETF, (you can probably guess), mimics the movement of the S&P 500 index.\n\n\nStock and Index ETFs are popular choices for medium and long term investors.\nThis is because the prominent indexes, such as the NASDAQ, GSPC (S&P 500), and DOW, tend to rise upwards at a steady pace, therefore supporting ETFs.\n\n\n\nLeveraged ETFs\nMoving away from conventional ETFs, Leveraged ETFs, or (LETFs) are higher risk, higher reward scenario choices.\nWhile conventional ETFs track a security at a steady 1:1 ratio, Leveraged ETFs (LETFs) aim for a higher yield ratio.\n\n\n\nMany leveraged ETFs move at a 2:1 or even 3:1 ratio, this means either 2x or even 3x volatility.\nFor example, take a 3:1 leveraged ETF that specifically tracked the stock of NVIDIA (NVDA).\nIf on this specific day, NVDA increased by 3%, the leveraged ETF would increase by 9%, as 3% at a 3:1 ratio would become 9%.\n\n\nThis aspect highlights the high-risk nature of many leveraged ETFs.\n\n\n\nLETF Decay\nWe have just highlighted the risk behind leveraged ETFs, ( LETFs).\nDespite that, leveraged ETFs carry another concern.\n\n\n\nDiverging from LETFs for a moment:\n“When you lose money, it becomes harder to make that money back”.\nA vivid example of this fact can be demonstrated:\n - You start with $100\n- You lose 10%, bringing the total to $90\n- You then regain 10%, but 10% of $90 is only $9\n- This means after a 10% loss, then a following 10% gain, you’re at $99 \n\n\nWe started with $100, but now we’re a dollar short? This is called decay.\n\n\nComing back to leveraged ETF scenario with a 3:1 LETF:\n - You start with $100\n- The stock loses 10%, meaning the LETF loses 30%\n- You now have $70\n- The stock regains 10%, meaning the LETF gains 30%\n- $70 multiplied by 1.30 = $91\n\n\nHere, we started with $100, but now have $91 left, meaning a 9% loss!\nWe then start to see the significantly higher decay possible when trading leveraged ETFs.\nTrading leveraged ETFs is extremely risky and isn’t advised unless you fully understand how they function.\n\n\n\nShort Selling\nMoving on, let’s discuss short-selling and covering.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Short-selling is not the same thing as selling, (not even remotely accurate).\nShort-selling will be referred to as “shorting” for the rest of this section.\n\n\nWe already know that when buying shares, you aim for the stock price to rise.\nHowever, with shorting, you instead are betting that the stock price will decline.\n\n\nExample:\nLet’s say you see JP Morgan Chase (JPM) at $210/share.\nThey then release a negative earnings report with shrinking revenue. (earnings reports etc. be covered in Fundamental Analysis).\nTheir stock would immediately decrease as a result, but you think they will continue to decline in the medium-term.\nIn this case, you would short JPM, as you believe their stock price will continue to decrease.\n\n\n\nCovering the Short\nA month later, JPM is now $150. The net-change is negative $60 from the original $210/share.\nThis means you made a $60 profit for each share shorted.\nHowever, now, you want to end your shorting position on JPM, and take the profit.\nTo eliminate a shorting position, you would cover you short.\nCovering terminates your sell-short, and you pocket the net-change.\n\n\n\n\nThe Internal Workings\nThe behind-the-scenes workings of short-selling can be explained relatively easily, however, they aren’t very important. For that reason, it won’t be listed here.\nHowever, if you’re interested in reading about it, an article explaining it is here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Is The Ceiling\nShorting additionally has a ceiling on the amount of returns you can achieve.\nThis contrasts from buying & selling, where the returns have an infinite potential to rise, as share price can theoretically go to infinity.\n\n\n\nThis is because, in short-selling, you’re betting the stock price will go down. But stock price can never go below zero, therefore limiting the returns possible from short-selling.\nShorting stocks is a risky trading approach, as the losses are theoretically infinite, but the gains are limited and finite.\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading the section for “Other Investing Practices”.\nThis section has covered several other trading approaches that are used in today’s stock market. Understanding different approaches and their risk factors is vital towards building a successful portfolio.\n\n\n\n Originally Published: 7/7/2024\nLast Revised: 9/2/2024\n\n\nWe value your feedback!
