The goal is to provide you with a more comprehensive view of different types of trading approaches. Option trading will be getting its own seperate tutorial\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\nThere are many reasons why one would want to use a different trading approach, rather than buying and selling a stock.\nSome approaches offer more stability and less risk, while others can offer higher risk and higher reward.\n\n\n\n\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nOne popular investing strategy is investing in ETFs.\nETFs are securities that can be bought and sold like stocks. They are funds that measure the movement of a collection of stocks or an index.\n\n\n\nAn Stock ETF is an ETF that acts as a basket of stocks, and the ETF takes the average performance of each stock, combining them to determine the overall movement of the individual ETF.\nTake the ETF: (CIBR). This ETF measures the average performance of several cybersecurity companies.\n(CIBR) is composed of percentages from each public company in the cybersecurity sector, making it a Stock ETF.\n\n\nAn Index ETF is an ETF that monitors the movement of a certain index.\nIndex ETFs are a relatively low risk investment choice, as indexes tend to be less volatile.\nAn example of an Index ETF is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). This ETF, (you can probably guess), mimics the movement of the S&P 500 index.\n\n\nStock and Index ETFs are popular choices for medium and long term investors.\nThis is because the major prominent indexes, such as the NASDAQ, GSPC (S&P 500), and DOW, tend to rise upwards at a steady pace, which additionally draws stock prices up.\n\n\n\nLeveraged ETFs\nMoving away from conventional ETFs, Leveraged ETFs, or (LETFs) are higher risk, higher reward scenario choices.\nWhile conventional ETFs track a security at a steady 1:1 ratio, Leveraged ETFs (LETFs) aim for a higher yield ratio.\n\n\n\nMany leveraged ETFs move at a 2:1 or even 3:1 ratio.\nFor example, take a 3:1 leveraged ETF that specifically tracked the stock of NVIDIA (NVDA).\nIf on this specific day, NVDA increased by 3%, the leveraged ETF would increase by 9%, as 3% at a 3:1 ratio would become 9%.\n\n\nThis aspect highlights the high-risk nature of many leveraged ETFs\n\n\n\nLETF Decay\nWe have just highlighted the risk behind leveraged ETFs, ( LETFs).\nDespite that, leveraged ETFs carry another concern.\n\n\n\nDiverging from LETFs for a moment:\n“When you lose money, it becomes harder to make that money back”.\nA vivid example of this fact can be demonstrated:\n - You start with $100\n- You lose 10%, bringing the total to $90\n- You then regain 10%, but 10% of $90 is only $9\n- This means after a 10% loss, then a following 10% gain, you’re at $99 \n\n\nWe started with $100, but now we’re a dollar short? This is called decay.\n\n\nComing back to leveraged ETF scenario with a 3:1 LETF:\n - You start with $100\n- The stock loses 10%, meaning the LETF loses 30%\n- You now have $70\n- The stock regains 10%, meaning the LETF gains 30%\n- $70 multiplied by 1.30 equals $91\n\n\nHere, we started with $100, but now have $91 left, meaning a 9% loss!\nWe then start to see the significantly higher decay possible when trading leveraged ETFs.\nTrading leveraged ETFs is extremely risky and isn’t advised unless you fully understand how they work.\n\n\n\nShort Selling\nMoving on, let’s discuss short-selling and covering.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Short-selling is not the same thing as selling, (not even remotely accurate).\nShort-selling will be referred to as “shorting” for the rest of this tutorial.\n\n\nWe know that when buying shares, you aim for the stock price to rise.\nHowever, with shorting, you instead are betting that the stock price will decline.\n\n\nExample:\nLet’s say you see JP Morgan Chase (JPM) at $210/share.\nThey then release a negative earnings report with shrinking revenue. (earnings reports etc. be covered in Fundamental Analysis).\nTheir stock would immediately decrease as a result, but you think they will continue to decline in the medium-term.\nIn this case, you would short JPM, as you believe their stock price will continue to decrease.\n\n\n\nCovering the Short\nA month later, JPM is now $150. The net change is negative $60 from the original $210/share.\nThis means you made a $60 profit for each share shorted.\nHowever, now, you want to end your shorting position on JPM, and take the profit.\nTo end a shorting position, you would cover you short.\nCovering terminates your sell-short, and you pocket the net-change.\n\n\n\n\nThe Internal Workings\nThe way shorting works can be explained relatively easily, however, it isn’t very important. For that reason, it won’t be listed in the tutorial.\nHowever, if you’re interested in reading how it works, an article explaining it is here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Limiting Factor\nShorting has a limit on the amount of returns you can achieve.\nThis contrasts from buying & selling, where the returns have an infinite potential to rise, as share price can theoretically go to infinity.\n\n\n\nRemember, when short-selling, you’re betting the stock price will go down. But stock price can never go below zero, therefore limiting the returns possible from short-selling.\nShorting stocks is a risky trading approach, as the losses are theoretically infinite, but the gains are limited to 100%.\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading the tutorial for “Other Investing Practices”.\nThis tutorial has covered several other trading approaches that are used in today’s stock market. Understanding different approaches and their risk factors is vital towards building a successful portfolio.\n\n\n\nOriginally Published: 7/7/2024 \n\n\nWe value your feedback!

    "text": "Important Stock Market Basics & Review \nClick on ‘Next’ to move to each section\n5 minute read time\n\n\n\nIntro\nThis tutorial covers foundational stock terms and their interconnections. Its aim is to establish a solid foundation in stocks, laying the groundwork for upcoming content.\nFor intermediate to more advanced traders, this tutorial would serve only as a refresher.\nTutorials and topics with more advanced content are on their way and will be covered when we move to Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.\nThe ‘Guide’ page contains the full list of topics and strategies.\n\n\n\n\nMarket-Cap\nReady? Let’s first talk about market-cap.\nMarket-cap is simple to understand, but foundational and essential in all types of trading.\nMarket-cap represents the value of a company, based upon the total value of all the company’s shares of stock.\nIt is often seen as the total value of the company, for example, Apple (AAPL) has a market-cap of ~3.4 T. Here, we would say “Apple is worth around 3.4 trillion”.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll revisit Market-Cap soon, lets run through Share Price first.\n\n\n\nShare Price\nWhen trading stocks, most of the time you are buying & selling shares. Shares represent small portions of companies.\nDid you know Elon Musk has 200 million shares of Tesla (TSLA)?\nCompanies have hundreds of millions of shares total, some having billions of shares outstanding. \n\n\n\nEvery share you buy has a price. Going back to our previous example, Apple (AAPL) has a share price of $220 / share.\nYou aim to buy shares at lower share prices, and sell them for a higher price in the future.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Never compare the share prices of different companies. Every company has its own unique share price.\nFor example, Costco (COST)’s share price is $800, but Apple (AAPL)’s is $220/share.\nDoes this mean Costco is bigger than Apple? No, in fact, Apple’s valuation is 9x higher than Costco’s.\n\n\n\nShare Price and Market-Cap Relation\nLet’s revisit Market-Cap, and connect it to share price.\nA company’s market cap moves proportional to the share price of its stock.\nThis is because market-cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the share price goes up from $100 to $120, the market-cap would increase as follows:\n\nInitial market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $100/share = $100,000,000\nNew market-cap: 1,000,000 shares * $120/share = $120,000,000\n\nThis shows how a change in the share price directly affects the market-cap.\n\n\n\nStock Fluctuation\nWhy do stocks move up and down?\nStocks fluctuate and move based on company performance.\nBut at a technical level, it’s a bit more complex.\n\n\n\nShare prices are affected directly by the demand of a stock.\nWhen the demand of a stock is high, there are more willing buyers attempting to purchase shares. However, due to the limited number of shares, the stock price must move up in order to balance out the number of willing buyers and sellers.\nVice versa, when the demand is low, the are more willing sellers than buyers. In order to balance the number of willing buyers and sellers, the share price goes down, increasing the number of buyers while decreasing the number of sellers.\n\n\nThis situation could be compared to the modern day supply chain. When there’s high demand, prices are higher, and vice versa.\nIn the end, demand of a stock is influenced by the performance of the company, making\nshare price fluctuate based on the performance of the company\n\n\n\n———————————–\nThe next couple sections will go by faster and will highlight additional key terms.\n\n\n\n\nVolume\nVolume is the number of shares traded in a day.\nVolume can be used to represent how active a stock is.\n\n\n\n\nIndexes\nNASDAQ, DOW JONES, S&P 500?\nDo those names ring a bell?\nThese are called indexes, and they measure the overall performance of their sectors or subsets.\n\n\n\nSectors are the various industries within the stock market as a whole.\nProminent Indexes:\nNASDAQ: technology and software sector\nDOW JONES: the 30 largest US companies\nS&P 500: the 500 largest US companies\n\n\nThese indexes are often used to measure the wellbeing of the overall stock market, and in turn, the economy.\n\n\n\nEarning Reports\nEarning reports are one of the most crucial factors within the stock market.\nAt its core, they highlight a company’s performance and economic state.\nThese include the revenue, net-income, EPS, forecast, and other factors of the company. (To be covered later on)\n\n\n\nThey play a critical role in determining price movement and they often lead to significant volatility and rapid price changes.\nBecause earnings are important and advanced, we will fully cover them when we start Fundamental Analysis.\n\n\n\n— Conclusion —\nYou’ve finished reading the Tutorial for “Important Stock Market Basics”.\nThis tutorial has covered the essentials and groundwork related to stocks, which will be crucial for our future material and discussions.\n\n\n\n Written by: Aedan Liao\nOriginally Published: 7/3/2024\nLast Revised: 7/5/2024\n\n\n\nWe value your feedback!
